# GoEuro Java Test

The is the proposed solution for GoEuroâ€™s Java Developer Test (https://github.com/goeuro/dev-test).

TODO list:
- We could use a library which automaically generate the Java Beans (Location and GeoLocation) based on the JSON scheme of the returned result. (for example, jsonschema2pojo).
- We could use some field extraction techniques to extract the required fields and write it to the CSV files.
- A more serious validation on the city parameter needs to done...
